# React 19 useEffect Callback Issue
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `useEffect` hook in React 19, specifically related to how callback functions are used within `setInterval`. Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected behavior such as incorrect state updates.

The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.
